# Using Extensions

modernGraphTool is designed to allow easier and safer addition and management of supplementary features through its Extension functionality.

Features like the equalizer panel, frequency tutorial, and target customizer are provided by default in the form of Extension modules.

## Extension Folder Structure

Extension-related files are located in the `/extensions` folder.

```
extensions/
├── equalizer/            # Equalizer Extension folder
│   ├── main.js
│   └── ...
└── extensions.config.js  # Extension activation and configuration file
```

*   Each Extension has a folder with a unique name (e.g., `equalizer`, `target-customizer`).
*   Each Extension folder may contain the core JavaScript file (`main.js`) that constitutes the Extension's functionality and other resource files.
*   The `extensions.config.js` file is an important file that defines which Extensions to activate and how to configure the detailed settings for each Extension.

## How to Activate and Configure Extensions (`extensions.config.js`)

You can open the `extensions.config.js` file with a text editor to change whether to use an Extension and its settings.

This file is structured as a JavaScript array, and each array element is an object representing a single Extension's configuration.

```javascript
export const EXTENSION_CONFIG = [
  {
    // name: Extension name (must be the same as the folder name)
    NAME: "equalizer",
    // description: Extension description (does not affect functionality)
    DESCRIPTION: `equalizer panel for modernGraphTool`,
    // enabled: Extension activation status (true: enabled, false: disabled)
    ENABLED: true,
    // I18N_ENABLED: Multilingual support activation status (true/false)
    // - Some Extensions may not provide this feature
    I18N_ENABLED: true,
    // CONFIG: Detailed configuration object for the Extension
    CONFIG: {
      INITIAL_EQ_BANDS: 5,  // Initial number of EQ bands
      MAXIMUM_EQ_BANDS: 20, // Maximum number of EQ bands
    },
  },
  // ... other Extension configurations
];
```

### Key Configuration Items

- **NAME** (Required): The name of the Extension. It **must be identical** to the Extension folder name within the `/extensions` folder.
- **ENABLED** (Required): Determines whether to use the Extension. Set to `true` to enable, `false` to disable.
- **I18N_ENABLED** (Optional): Sets whether the Extension will use modernGraphTool's multilingual features. This item may not exist if the extension does not support multilingual features.
- **CONFIG** (Optional): An object for detailed settings specific to the Extension. The configurable items vary for each Extension. You can change the settings by referring to the comments within each Extension's `CONFIG` object or related documentation.

### How to Enable/Disable Extensions

1. Open the `extensions.config.js` file in a text editor.
2. Find the configuration object for the Extension you want to enable or disable (identified by the `NAME` key).
3. Modify the `ENABLED` value of that object to `true` (enable) or `false` (disable).
4. If necessary, change the detailed settings within the `CONFIG` object.
5. Save the file and refresh the web page to see if the changes have been applied.

### How to Add Extensions

1. Move the newly downloaded Extension folder into the `/extensions` folder.
2. Add the configuration items written by the developer to the `extensions.config.js` file.
3. Set the `ENABLED` value to `true` to activate the Extension.
4. If necessary, configure the detailed settings within the `CONFIG` object.
5. Save the file and refresh the web page to see if the changes have been applied.
