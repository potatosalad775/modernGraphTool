# Dual-Hosting modernGraphTool & CrinGraph

You can host modernGraphTool and CrinGraph together with slight change of code! 

This chapter showcases how to dual-host 2 graphtools in 1 domain.

## Overview

There are several ways to host two services on a single domain. 

Here, we showcase the classic "folder as subdomain" approach, which is simple and effective for static sites or web apps.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Prepare Your Projects

- **modernGraphTool**: Set up the modernGraphTool database and files as described in the [other documentation chapters](../category/guide-for-admins).
- **CrinGraph**: Prepare the CrinGraph project files. You can use any variant of CrinGraphs.

### 2. Organize Your Directory Structure

Your root folder should contain the main `index.html` for modernGraphTool. 

Create a new folder (e.g., `cringraph/`) inside the root directory, and place all CrinGraph files there. 

The `cringraph/` folder should also have its own `index.html`.

Example structure:

```plaintext
/project-root/
├── data
|   ├── phones          # 'phone' measurements folder
|   ├── target          # 'target' measurements folder
|   └── phone_book.json # List of phones
├── index.html          # modernGraphTool entry point
├── ...other modernGraphTool files...
└── cringraph/
    ├── index.html      # CrinGraph entry point
    └── ...other CrinGraph files...
```

### 3. Required Changes to CrinGraph

Since we don't want to manage 2 data folders for each graphtool respectively, We need to update CrinGraph's code to correctly fetch data from parent directory.

Required changes will be made in two files:

- `graphtool.js`
- `config.js` (and `config_hp.js` if you have one)

The following examples are based on the [squiglink/labs version](https://github.com/squiglink/lab) of CrinGraph.

:::tip[Tip]
Even if you are using a different version of CrinGraph, you should be able to follow the examples below without any problems. However, there may be slight differences in details such as line positions.
:::

#### graphtool.js

Head over to line 787, and edit `loadFiles` function.

```js
// Previous
let l = f => d3.text(DIR+f+".txt").catch(()=>null);
let f = p.isTarget ? [l(p.fileName)]
      : d3.merge(LR.map(s =>
            sampnums.map(n => l(p.fileName+" "+s+n))));

// After
// If you're using custom directory for measurements, change the 'phones' and 'target' words to yours.
let l = f => d3.text(DIR+"phones/"+f+".txt").catch(()=>null);
let lt = f => d3.text(DIR+"target/"+f+".txt").catch(()=>null);
let f = p.isTarget ? [lt(p.fileName)]
      : d3.merge(LR.map(s =>
            sampnums.map(n => l(p.fileName+" "+s+n))));
```

#### config.js

Head over to line 3, and edit `DIR`:

```js
// Previous
DIR = "data/",

// After
// '../' means 'parent directory'.
DIR = "../data/", 
```

If you're using Haruto's iteration of CrinGraph ([PublicGraphTool](https://github.com/HarutoHiroki/PublicGraphTool) / [ExtendedGraphTool](https://github.com/potatosalad775/ExtendedGraphTool)), 
You should change this line too : 

```js
// Previous at Line 55
PHONE_BOOK = "phone_book.json", // Path to phone book JSON file

// After
PHONE_BOOK = "../data/phone_book.json", // Path to phone book JSON file
```

### 4. Adding Navigation Buttons to Each Tool

After finishing the code-weaving job above, you should be able to access 2 graphtools via these domains.

- To access modernGraphTool: `https://yourdomain.com/`
- To access CrinGraph: `https://yourdomain.com/cringraph/` (Folder name as subdomain)

We can add little buttons so users can easily navigate between these two.

#### modernGraphTool

Head over to `config.js` and add these line:
```js
TOPBAR: {
  LINK_LIST: { TITLE: "Go to CrinGraph", URL: "https://yourdomain.com/cringraph" },
  // or
  LINK_LIST: { TITLE: "Go to CrinGraph", URL: "./cringraph" },
}
```

#### CrinGraph

Head over to `config.js` and add these line:
```js
headerLinks = [
  {
    name: "Head back to modernGraphTool",
    url: "https://yourdomain.com/"
  },
  // or
  {
    name: "Head back to modernGraphTool",
    url: "../"
  },
]
```

### 5. Deploying

Upload your project to your web server, ensuring the folder structure is preserved. 

Both tools should now be accessible as described above.
