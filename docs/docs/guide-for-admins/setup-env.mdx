# Setting Up Your Environment

This guide explains the basic environment setup for using and managing modernGraphTool.

## Prerequisites

1.  **modernGraphTool Project Files**: Source code containing the core functionalities for visualizing and analyzing frequency response data.
2.  **Text Editor**: A program for modifying various configuration files (`.js`, `.css`, `.json`).

## Preparing Project Files

1.  Download the [latest source code zip file](https://github.com/potatosalad775/modernGraphTool/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) from the [modernGraphTool Github repository](https://github.com/potatosalad775/modernGraphTool).
2.  Extract the downloaded zip file.
3.  Locate the `dist` folder within the extracted folder. The files necessary for website operation exist only within the `dist` folder, so **only the contents of the `dist` folder need to be uploaded to the actual web server.**

## Installing a Text Editor (VS Code Recommended)

While various text editors are available, using [Visual Studio Code (VS Code)](https://code.visualstudio.com/), which offers convenient features like code highlighting and auto-completion, is recommended.

VS Code can be downloaded for free by anyone and supports Windows, macOS, and Linux.

1.  Go to the [VS Code website](https://code.visualstudio.com/), download the installer for your operating system, and install it.
2.  After launching VS Code, click the Extensions icon (square block shape) in the left menu.
3.  Search for the names below directly in the search bar or click the links to install the two extensions:
    1.  [`Live Server`](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer): Convenient for previewing changes to the database website in real-time.
    2.  [`Error Lens`](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=usernamehw.errorlens): Helps users unfamiliar with code editing to quickly find errors.

You are now ready to change modernGraphTool settings and manage data.

## Opening the Page

1.  Open the modernGraphTool project folder in VS Code.
2.  Double-click the `index.html` file to open it in VS Code.
3.  Click the `Go Live` button in the bottom right corner to run modernGraphTool.
