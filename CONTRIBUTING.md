# Contributing
Contributions are always welcome, no matter how small or large!

You can contribute to modernGraphTool project in many ways.

## Code
If you want to contribute to the codebase, you can start by forking the project on GitHub.

Then, you can create a new branch for your changes.

Finally, you can create a pull request to merge your changes into the main branch.

## Documentation
If you want to edit, or add to the documentation, you can head over to the [`/docs/docs`](/docs/docs) folder.

You can add or edit the .mdx (Markdown with JSX) files and create a pull request to merge your changes into the main branch.

If you aren't familiar with GitHub, you can send me the file by [email](mailto:blackbox0209@gmail.com).

## Translations
If you want to help translate the project, you can start by translating several string files.

You can start by creating a copy of `en.json` files, rename them with the [ISO 639 language code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639_language_codes) of the language you want.

For example, if you want to translate the project to French, you can create a copy of `en.json` file and rename it to `fr.json`.

Then, you can edit the file and translate the strings.

You can create a pull request to merge your changes into the main branch, but if you aren't familiar with GitHub, you can send me the file by [email](mailto:blackbox0209@gmail.com).

### Core Strings
You can find strings for modernGraphTool core script in [`/dist/assets/strings/en.json`](/dist/assets/strings/en.json) file.

### Extension Strings
Each extensions should have its own strings file inside `/strings` folder. 

You can find strings for modernGraphTool default extensions in `/dist/extensions/*/strings/en.json` file.

### Documentation
Adding translations for docusaurus documentation is kinda tricky. 

You are supposed to create translation data folder inside `/docs/i18n` folder by running some commands. Please check out [`/docs/README.md`](/docs/README.md) file for more information.

If you aren't familiar with these, you can ask me to create locale for you. Please send me a [email](mailto:blackbox0209@gmail.com) for that.
